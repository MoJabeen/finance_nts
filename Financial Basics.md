### 1. What is a 10-K?

- An annual report
- Synopsis of a companies strategy and results for a fiscal (*tax*) year  
- Includes info to shareholders, auiditing and unregluated highlights
- Balance sheet, income statment and cash flow statment

### 2. What is a 10-Q?

- Quartley report
- Reduced version of 10-k -> focus on statments

# Statements

**Income statment**: Revenue - Cost of Goods sold - Expenses = Net income

**Balance Sheet**: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

**Statment of cash flows**: Beginning Cash (prior Balance Sheet) + Cash flow (CF) from operations + CF from Investing + CF from Financing = Ending Cash

- Includes non cash expenses (*expenses that dont include actual cash transactions*)
- Non expense purchases: Debt repayment and issuance, capital expendiatures, 

## What is the connection between these documents ?

- Net income minus dividens added to retained earning from last periods balance sheet
    - Dividens is removed as this is paid to shareholders before calcuating the actual retainted amount
  
_Dividens : Distribution of profits to shareholders._

- Beginning Cash = prior balanace sheet | End cash = current periods balance sheet

## Summarise the Income statment and its links?

The income statment includes the revenue generated minus the cost of creation minus expenses to give the net income.

Links to balance sheet:
- The debt shown on the balance sheet is used to calculate the interest expenses. 
- The depreciation and amortization expense is calculated based on PP&E (plant, property and equipment) from the balance sheet.
- Net income - divdens paid = retained earnings added to prior balance sheet

Links to Cash flow:
- The net income is the starting point for the cash flow.

_Amortization (in lending context): Paying off a debt in equal installments over a period of time, will pay the principal and interest._

_Amortization (in accounting context): Spreading the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. Normally done over fixed periods._

An expense on the income statement should be tax deductible.

### What is operating income?

Gross profit (Revenue - Cost of goods sold) - operating expenses - depreciation - amortization

### What is pre tax income?

Operating income - interest expenses - other expenses

### What is net income?

pre tax income - income tax provision

### Summarise the Balance sheet and its links

Gives the value of the total assets, which is calculated by the libalities + shareholder equity.

**Example assets:**

- Cash, short term investments (almost liquid), inventory (produced not sold), accounts receivable (recieved IOUs), Prepaid expense (expense not recognised in income statment), PP&E, intangible assets (trademarks, patents and other), goodwill (premium over company market value), long term investment.

**Example Liabilties:**

- Revolver (line of credit), accounts payable (sent IOUs), deffered revenue (service cost delievered over a period), accured expenses (recorded on income statment but not fully paid ie recurring expense)


### Summarise the Cash flows statment and its links?

The statment is often not a true reflection of cash flow in and out of the company due to most companies using accural accounting, it is meant to show all the companies sources and uses of cash.

_Accural accounting: Financial accounting method recording revenue before receiving payment for goods or expenses recorded before being payed for._

Three main components of the CF statment:

- **Cash from Operations** : Normal operation, sales and changes in working captial
  
_Working captial : Difference between a companies current assets and current liabilties_

- **Cash from Investing**: Captial expenditure, assest sales.
- **Cash from Financing**: Debt, equity issuance, cost of debt and equity repurchase.

Amoritization and depreciation are not included in the CF statment as they expenses but not use of actual cash.

### What is the best statment for evaluating the state of a company?

The cash flow statment will show how much money is going in and out of the bussiness and a reasonable reflection on finacial peformance.

### What is goodwill?

- It is an asset that describes the amount paid for an acquisition - its equity amount.
- I.e if 100 mil is paid for company B and its equity is 50 mil, Goodwill = 50 mil.

## What is EBITDA?

EBITDA is Earning Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization. 

- A proxy for free cash flow to pay for expenses
- EBITDA = Revenue - Expenses (non interest, tax, depreciation and amortization)

- EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value as multiple of its EBITDA.

- Total Debt/EBITDA is the companies leverage ratio
- Total Interest/EBITDA is the companies interest ratio

## What is Enterprise Value?

The value of the firm, to be paid in an acquisition.

> Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest - Cash

_Net Debt: Debt - available cash_

## What is LBO Valuation ?

A leverage buy out:

- A firm uses a higher than normal amount of debt to finance the purchase of a company.

- A percentage of the companies equity is purchased, and the rest financed with debt.

- Often the companies assets are used as collateral to take the bank loan, the debt is paid off with the cash flow generated by the company. Until they at least become majority owners.

### What is a liquidation valuation ?

- A company sold all of its assets (PP&E, inventory, etc).
  
### What is Sum of parts valuation method ?

- A company multiple divisions which are valued separately then put together.

## Which valuation method results in the highest valuation ?

General order:

- Precedent Transactions (Due to the often paid premiums during a merger).
- Discounted Cash flow (Often optimistic).
- Market comparison and valuation give the lowest valuations.

## How do you value a private company ?

- Market val is not possible and the DCF method is slightly altered.

- Generally use a 10-15% discount when doing comp analysis due to the prem added for being publicly traded.

*Spreading comps : Collecting and calculating relevant multiples (EV/EBITDA) for comparable companies.*

### What is calculated Enterprise value or EV when using multiples based on free cash flow or EBITDA ?

- EBITDA and free cash flow represent money available to repay debt or equity, a value based on one of those would represent the value of the firm (EV).

## Discounted Cash Flow model

> Free cash flow = EBIT*(1-tax rate) + (depreciation and amortization) - capital expenditures - the change in net working capital.

*Weighted Average Cost of Capital == WACC*

> Enterprise Value = Final Cash Flow (CF)/(1+WACC) + CF2/(1+WACC)^2 ..

### How do you estimate free cash flows beyond 5 years ?

Two methods: Terminal growth multiple or Perpetuity method

> Terminal Value (perpetuity method) = FCF(1+g)/(WACC-g)

*g is the growth rate (GDP growth or inflation)*

- Terminal multiple method, assign valuation multiple to final year projection and use that as the terminal value.

### How do you calculate WACC ?

The overall cost of a company raising new capital, which also is a representation of the riskiness of investment in the company.

TODO: Add more

### Explain net working capital ?

> Net working captial = Current Assets - Current Liabilities 

- A measure of if the company can pay off its liabilities with its assets. 

**Revenue is not recognized until the good or service is delivered to the customer.**

## What is an IPO ?

Initial public offering

- Public sale of stock in a previously private company
- Negatives: Sharing of profits with public investors, loss of confidentiality, loss of control, IPO fees and legal liabilities.

- Complicated process lead by a investment bank

## What is the primary and secondary market ?

An IB can choose to sell to large institutional investors before placing the stock on exchanges. This is the primary market and the secondary market is where the security is traded after IPO ie exchanges.

*Primary Market*: Securities sold before going to the market

*Secondary Market* : Securities sold on the market

### What is the capital assets price model ?

The capital assets price model (CAPM) is used to calculate the expected/required return on equity. Or the cost of equity of a company.

> CAPM = Risk free rate + Stock volatility*Market risk premium

### What is the risk free rate ?

The rate from risk free borrows rated AAA, such as the government. Usually calculated from the 10 year bond yield.

### What is Beta ?

Beta is the relative volatility or risk of a given investment compared to the market.

- $\beta$ < 1 is less volatile than the market 
- $\beta$ > 1 more volatile than the market

- $\beta$ < 0 opposite the market (Gold has negative beta)

if $\beta$=1.2 the security is 20% more volatile than the market

### How can you make the cash flow statment using balance sheet and income statment ?

The balance sheet for the beginning and end of a period + the income statment from the end of a period gives you cash flows.

### When is an asset capitalized instead of expensed ?

If the benefits of the asset are retrieved over a long period of time then its capitalized otherwise expensed.

Expenditures have benefits realized over a period and therefore depreciate. Expenses are immediately realized.

### How is amortization, depreciation and expenses shown in the statements ?

- Non cash expenses (amortization and depreciation) reduce the income statment but increase the cash flow.
- Cash expenses reduce the cash flow.

### What is market risk premium ?

Excess required to choose stocks over risk free securities.

> Average return on market - risk free rate (yield on a 10 year treasury bond)

### How would you value a company with no revenue ?

Using the projected cash flow of the company, create a DCF model. 

### What is a tax shield ?

Is the tax saving from interest expenses.

### What is the weighted average cost of capital ?

$WACC = \sum (rate of return on security) * (Market value of outstanding securities) MV/ \sum{MV}$

Summed over the number of sources of capital

## Capital structure

- There are multiple layers of debt and equity used to structure a company. The layers have a different order in repayment during a bankruptcy or default.

### What is the standard capital structure ?

The order shown below is the in order of pay outs in response to a bankruptcy.

**DEBT:**

- Senior 
- Mezzanine
- Subordinated

**Equity:**

- Preffered
  - Pays out a dividend
  - In a bankruptcy preferred to common stock
- Common stock
  - Can be entitled to company profits
  - No rights to company assets
  - Lowest priority in bankruptcy

### When is equity preferred to debt ?

- If share prices is overpriced it is a good time to issue equity
- Investments are short term unable to pay interest
- A need to pay down the debt
- Owners want to monetize their investment
